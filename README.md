Google-Glass-Telus
==================
This app was created as part of a competition to combine Google Glass with Telus. 
It was created in a team of three: Apoorav Gupta, Martin Gagne, Haemanth Subburaman

It allows you to search from a variety of TELUS locations (including unofficial stores) and obtain information about them (which is only available on the TELUS website). The user can also set a favorite, call the store, and get directions. 
This app can be integrated with TELUS to give the user access to their account and to show them personalized ads and discounts. 

The application was modified for demo purposes to use a pre-written text file containing store information (in order to easily edit for demonstration). Otherwise, nothing is changed.
